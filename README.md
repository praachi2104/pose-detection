## 📌 About the Project

This project is part of a fitness application idea aimed at helping users perform exercises correctly using computer vision. It focuses on **squat detection** and **repetition counting** using pose landmarks captured by a webcam.

✅ Built with beginner-friendly tools  
✅ Detects key body points to track movement  
✅ Counts squat reps in real time  
✅ Great base for extending to other exercises
